## Dashboard creation using Tableau visualization involves the following steps:
1.Connect to Data: Start by connecting to your data source within Tableau. This can be done by selecting the appropriate option from the "Connect" menu and selecting the file, database, or other data source you want to use.

2.Create Worksheets: Build individual worksheets by dragging and dropping fields from your data onto the Tableau canvas. Choose the appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar chart, line chart, map) to represent your data effectively. Customize each worksheet by adjusting colors, labels, and formatting options.

3.Arrange Worksheets: To create a dashboard, select the "New Dashboard" option from the "Dashboard" menu. Drag the worksheets you created onto the dashboard canvas and arrange them in a layout that makes sense for your data and analysis goals. Resize and reposition the worksheets as needed.

4.Add Interactivity: Enhance the interactivity of your dashboard by adding filters, parameters, and actions. Filters allow users to interactively select subsets of data to explore. Parameters provide dynamic control over certain aspects of the visualization. Actions enable interactivity between different worksheets or visualizations.

5.Format and Customize: Customize the appearance of your dashboard by adjusting colors, fonts, and styles to align with your branding or design preferences. Add titles, captions, and annotations to provide context and guide users through the dashboard.

6.Test and Refine: Review your dashboard for any errors or inconsistencies. Interact with the filters and actions to ensure they work as intended. Test the responsiveness and usability of the dashboard on different devices and screen sizes.

7.Publish and Share: Once your dashboard is ready, publish it to Tableau Server or Tableau Public, or export it as a standalone file. Share the dashboard with your intended audience, either by providing access to the published version or distributing the file directly.
